# [Implement NN without any libraries]()
The goal of this code is to help you understand the architecture of NN, Forward Propagation and Backward Propagation procedure more clearly.

* The concept of NN was discussed in [week4](https://medium.com/@qempsil0914/courseras-machine-learning-notes-week4-non-linear-hypothesis-and-artificial-neural-network-a3c4bbdecb41) and [week5](https://medium.com/@qempsil0914/courseras-machine-learning-notes-week5-neural-network-lost-function-forward-and-backward-8b293401e4dc). 
* The [step-by-step tutorial](https://medium.com/@qempsil0914/implement-neural-network-without-using-deep-learning-libraries-step-by-step-tutorial-python3-e2aa4e5766d1) is available.
